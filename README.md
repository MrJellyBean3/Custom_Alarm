# Custom_Alarm
This is a program that uses a motion detector from an arduino with a dedicated computer to work as an alarm clock. The program has a 15 minute period after your alarm starts to smart wake up with the alarm noise only activating when you move and then once you do you can snooze with a button placed wherever you prefer. If you snooze twice without getting out of bed the next time the alarm goes off you have to pres the spacebar on your keyboard to stop the alarm. Pressing the spacebar also changes the code so that the alarm turns on each time it detects motion in your bed preventing you from going back to sleep.
